# To-Do list

## initial commit

- import what I need for the developpment :
  - Angular Material
  - Jest (I prefere jest for unit test, so I have to remove Karma and Jasmine)

- Configure Jest (create jest config etc)
- Configure Angular Theme
- Clean up app.component

## Service, Models

- Create models for request: Town, Department & Region
- Create service for geo call
- Create the two components

## Region Search

- Use mat-autocomplete to list and select Region (be careful with observables, try to reduce call)
- Use mat-list or something like this, with selectable item to get departmentCode

## Department Details

- display this component in the region search and input departmentcode
- Use matDataSource for display list, use paginator and sort to add some feature
